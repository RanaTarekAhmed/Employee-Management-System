# Employee Management System

A RESTful API built with **Node.js**, **Express.js**, **MongoDB (Mongoose)**, **JWT**, **bcryptjs**, and **Multer** for managing employees and HR operations.

---

# 📌 Project Overview

The Employee Management System is a backend REST API that manages employee records and HR-related operations. It provides CRUD functionality for employees along with additional modules for departments, attendance, leave management, payroll, performance, and notifications.

The project also includes a complete authentication and authorization system that allows users to register, log in securely, access protected routes using JWT, and restrict actions based on user roles.

The Employee module has been enhanced with professional backend features including filtering, pagination, sorting, and image upload.
